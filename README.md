This is a very simple app that I can practice CRUD operations against a real database. In this project I am using ADO.NET, because itâ€™s the closest to raw SQL.
It's a project from The C# Academy.

Big Challenges:
- [x] Use parameterized queries to make your application more secure.
- [x] Let the users create their own habits to track. That will require that you let them choose the unit of measurement of each habit.
- [x] Seed Data into the database automatically when the database gets created for the first time, generating a few habits and inserting a hundred records with randomly generated values. This is specially helpful during development so you don't have to reinsert data every time you create the database.
- [ ] Create a report functionality where the users can view specific information (i.e. how many times the user ran in a year? how many kms?) SQL allows you to ask very interesting things from your database.
